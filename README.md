# coffee-site
A freecodecamp practice project

Just a practice run done step by step on freecodecamp.
You can do the course here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu

The next step is learning flexbox so I can make a personal site/portfolio for my art.

Take care of yourselves!
